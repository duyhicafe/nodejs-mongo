By popular demand, I am releasing the source of the game as of version 1.5.18. The game engine is under MIT license while the game content is under GPL license.

While the version 1.5.18 of the game is public, more recent versions of the game are not. I am not offering support nor planning to maintain the public version of the game. The more recent versions of the game will NOT be released on Github.
